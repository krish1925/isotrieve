# Isotrieve Design Decisions

Running log of design choices and open questions.
Bias toward the boring, verifiable choice.

## Postmortems

### 2026-07-19 — Number Discrepancy Postmortem (WS-0)

**Symptom:** Adapter sweep reported Ridge/K=4000/SciFact = 0.866 ± 0.008. K-sweep reported the same nominal config = 0.814 ± 0.068. The ±0.068 (8× larger std) flagged a discrepancy.

**Root cause:** The K-sweep summary (`run_benchmark.py` line 538) filtered by `k_cal` but **not by adapter**. When running `--adapter ridge lowrank mlp --k 500 1000 2000 4000`, the K-sweep summary averaged across ALL adapters for each K value:
- ridge K=4000: 0.866 ± 0.008
- lowrank K=4000: 0.857 ± 0.009
- mlp K=4000: 0.719 ± 0.008
- **All-adapter average at K=4000: 0.814 ± 0.068** ← this was the K-sweep number

The adapter sweep was adapter-specific (ridge only). Two valid but different experiments, presented in a way that implied they should match.

**Resolution:**
1. K-sweep summary now broken down by adapter (`run_benchmark.py` updated).
2. `protocol` field added to result JSON (`fixed_calibration_per_seed`).
3. Audit script `benchmarks/audit_configs.py` committed for field-by-field comparison.
4. CLAIMS.md and DECISIONS.md updated to distinguish adapter-specific vs cross-adapter numbers.

**Lesson:** Always declare which dimension (adapter, K, seed) a summary averages over. The `protocol` field in result JSONs makes this explicit.

## Locked decisions

### 2026-07-19 — Package strategy (Phase 1)

**Choice:** Rewrite `isotrieve-python` onto a `src/isotrieve/` layout as the migration toolkit.
The old agent-protocol API under the flat `isotrieve/` package is excluded from the
build and deferred to a later "advanced usage" docs page. TypeScript (`@isotrieve/core`)
is out of scope for v1.

**Why:** The product contract repositions Isotrieve as embedding-space migration, not
agent handoff. One excellent Python package beats two mediocre packages. The PyPI
name `isotrieve` must not collide with a second package.

### 2026-07-19 — Version reset

**Choice:** Ship as `0.1.0` (alpha), not continue from marketed `1.0.0`.

**Why:** Public claims from the old package are unverified. Starting at 0.1.0
signals that numbers are earned via the benchmark harness.

### 2026-07-19 — License

**Choice:** Apache-2.0 (per product contract). Previous MIT license in this
directory is superseded for the new package.

### 2026-07-19 — Mapping defaults

**Choice:** `RidgeMapping` is primary; `OrthogonalProcrustesMapping` only when
`d_src == d_tgt`. All `transform` outputs are L2-normalized. Ridge uses an
augmented bias column and `alpha="auto"` via leave-one-out GCV over a log grid
(`sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV`).

**Why:** Rectangular maps (1536→3072) are the normal case; Procrustes cannot
handle them. Normalization matches retrieval practice and makes cosine metrics
stable.

### 2026-07-19 — No wall-clock expiry on `.isotrieve` files

**Choice:** Header includes `expires_hint` for operator convenience but the
library never auto-expires. Drift detection is `isotrieve verify` (fresh probe embeds).

**Why:** Model weights do not drift on a calendar; silent provider updates do.

### 2026-07-19 — Phase 1 scope

**Choice:** Implement core math, quality metrics, numpy store, minimal file CLI,
offline tests, and a local-model SciFact harness before any API providers or
vector-DB adapters.

### 2026-07-19 — Phase 1 gate result (first honest number)

**Measured** on SciFact test (300 queries with qrels), in-domain K=4000,
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` → `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`, 3 seeds:

| | nDCG@10 |
|--|---------|
| Floor (raw cross-space; dims 384≠1024) | 0.000 |
| Isotrieve (mapped) | ≈ 0.640 |
| Ceiling (full re-embed) | ≈ 0.735 |
| **Retention (Isotrieve÷ceiling)** | **0.871 ± 0.006** |

Artifacts under `benchmarks/results/`. Rank warning: MiniLM source matrix was
slightly rank-deficient (382/384) at K=4000 — logged, not hidden.

**Gate status:** PASSED — Isotrieve retention meaningfully above floor.

### 2026-07-19 — Phase 1 prerequisite fixes (before Phase 2)

Inferred from Phase 1 debt + contaminated artifacts (PM referenced "four fixes
above" without the prior message in-thread). Logged here for audit:

| Fix | Action |
|-----|--------|
| F1 | Purge `self_retrieval_fallback` result JSONs; harness **requires** real BEIR qrels for claimable runs — no silent fallback |
| F2 | Record **holdout-vs-corpus optimism gap** (fit holdout top-1 − retrieval retention) in every result + QualityGate |
| F3 | **CachedEmbedder mandatory** on all provider/CLI/benchmark embed paths — never embed the same text twice |
| F4 | Gate/corpus sample must be **disjoint from calibration**; rank-deficiency stays a warning (ridge handles it) |

### 2026-07-19 — Phase 2 adapter zoo

**Choice:** Add 4 adapters to the existing Ridge: Procrustes (square only), Procrustes+Diagonal, LowRankAffine, ResidualMLP. Ridge remains the default for rectangular mappings.

**Why:** Drift-Adapter (EMNLP 2025) validates Procrustes and MLP approaches. LowRankAffine provides compressed matrices. Each adapter has different compute/memory/quality tradeoffs.

**Measured (SciFact, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 → bge-large-en-v1.5, K=4000, 3 seeds):**

| Adapter | nDCG@10 retention | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Ridge | 0.866 ± 0.008 | Default. Fast, stable. |
| LowRank | 0.857 ± 0.009 | Compressed matrix. ~1% worse than Ridge. |
| MLP | 0.719 ± 0.008 | No hyperparameter tuning. Significantly worse than linear. |

### 2026-07-19 — Phase 2 K-sweep (data-driven gate thresholds)

**Choice:** Benchmark across K=500,1000,2000,4000 to derive QualityGate thresholds from data.

**Measured (SciFact, all adapters averaged, 3 seeds):**

| K | nDCG@10 retention | Notes |
|---|------------------|-------|
| 500 | 0.667 ± 0.039 | Below recommended minimum. Rank-deficient. |
| 1000 | 0.732 ± 0.056 | Still below minimum. Better but high variance. |
| 2000 | 0.788 ± 0.054 | Approaching acceptable quality. |
| 4000 | 0.814 ± 0.068 | Full quality. Recommended minimum. |

**Gate thresholds derived:**
- PASS: retention ≥ 0.75 (K≥2000 typically achieves this)
- WARN: 0.55 ≤ retention < 0.75 (K=500-1000 range, or poor mapping)
- FAIL: retention < 0.55 (mapping fundamentally broken)

### 2026-07-19 — K minimum constraint downgraded to warning

**Choice:** Change adapter `fit()` from raising `ValueError` on small K to issuing `UserWarning`. The 10×min_dim rule is a guideline, not a hard error.

**Why:** Users need to see what happens with small K. The benchmark harness needs to sweep across K values for threshold calibration. Warning gives visibility without blocking experimentation.

### 2026-07-19 — MLP rectangular dims

**Choice:** ResidualMLP uses plain MLP (no residual skip) when d_src ≠ d_tgt. Residual skip only when dimensions match.

**Why:** The residual connection `x + net(x)` requires matching input/output dims. Rectangular projections need a feedforward architecture.

### 2026-07-19 — QualityGate v2: proxy-based prediction (not raw holdout)

**Choice:** Redefine gate thresholds from "requires ceiling measurement" to "predicts retention from holdout proxy using isotonic regression." Gate model ships with the package (`gate_model_v1.json`). Gate verdict uses prediction intervals.

**Why:** The old gate required ceiling quality (full re-embed) to measure retention — defeating the purpose of a migration tool. The new gate predicts retention from holdout proxies that are always available: `top1_retention`, `holdout_rank_corr`, `cosine_mean`. Trained on 48 benchmark results (4 adapter pairs), LOPO CV: MAE=0.0443, RMSE=0.0592, 80% interval half-width=0.0706.

**Artifacts:** `gate_model_v1.json`, `benchmarks/fit_gate_model.py`, `benchmarks/results/gate_lopo.json`

### 2026-07-19 — Same-dimension floor is 0.0

**Choice:** Measure bge-large→e5-large (1024→1024) raw cross-space retrieval. Floor = 0.0.

**Why:** "Same dimension" is not "same space." Different models produce geometrically incompatible embeddings even at the same dimension. Raw cross-space nDCG@10 = 0.0 — search runs fine, results are garbage. This is the core problem Isotrieve solves. Retention = 0.908 with mapping (with e5 prefixes).

### 2026-07-19 — e5 prefix bug (postmortem)

**Symptom:** Same-dim pair (bge-large→e5-large) showed ceiling nDCG@10 = 0.355, retention = 95%. e5-large alone scores ~0.74 on SciFact — ceiling was clearly broken.

**Root cause:** e5 models require `"query: "` / `"passage: "` text prefixes for correct embeddings. The benchmark harness passed raw texts with no prefix handling. Both documents and queries were embedded without prefixes, degrading e5's retrieval quality by ~50%.

**Resolution:** Added `MODEL_PREFIXES` dict to `run_benchmark.py` with model-specific prefix mappings. Modified `embed_texts()` and `load_or_embed()` to apply correct prefixes. Cache invalidated via `prefix_version` field.

**Corrected results:**
- Before fix: ceiling=0.355, Isotrieve=0.337, retention=0.950 (broken)
- After fix: ceiling=0.722, Isotrieve=0.656, retention=0.908 (honest)

**Lesson:** Model-specific preprocessing (prefixes, tokenization quirks) must be part of the embedding pipeline, not assumed to be "just encode text." When a number looks too good (95% retention), verify the ceiling is realistic.

### 2026-07-19 — Bidirectional evaluation

**Choice:** Evaluate both directions: source→target (transform corpus) AND target→source (map queries). Report "query→legacy retention" = 86.2% of ceiling.

**Why:** Serve-mode quality is measured by mapping queries into legacy space (query→legacy), not by transforming corpus (legacy→target). Both directions matter for the "before/after" narrative.

### 2026-07-20 — WS-A: Score recalibration (isotonic regression)

**Choice:** Fit isotonic regression (sklearn `IsotonicRegression`) on held-out query scores to map cross-space cosine scores to ceiling-equivalent scores. Recalibrator saved alongside mapping in `.isotrieve` format under `score_recal_v1` section.

**Why:** Raw cross-space scores are compressed (mean 0.157 vs ceiling 0.521 for MiniLM→bge rectangular pair). This means τ-thresholding based on ceiling scores fails on migrated data. Recalibration makes τ-thresholding reliable.

**Measured:**
- bge→e5 (same-dim): Raw scores agree at 100% for τ≤0.75. Recalibration helps only at τ=0.80 (+4.7% agreement, +2.36pt recall). MAE=0.095, margin compression=0.83x.
- MiniLM→bge (rectangular): Raw scores severely compressed (MAE=0.364). Recalibration essential: τ=0.60 goes 78%→100% (+22%), τ=0.70 goes 27%→67% (+40%). Margin compression=0.85x.

**Artifacts:** `benchmarks/results/ws_a_*_recall_tables.json`

### 2026-07-20 — WS-B: Cross-encoder reranking NULL RESULT

**Choice:** Do NOT ship cross-encoder reranking. MS MARCO cross-encoder (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) is domain-mismatched for scientific text.

**Measured:** -10.7pts on bge→e5, -9.8pts on MiniLM→bge. Consistent degradation.

**Why not:** Would need domain-matched cross-encoder (e.g., SciFact-trained). Not worth the complexity until proven on in-domain data.

**Artifacts:** `benchmarks/results/ws_b_cross_encoder.json`

### 2026-07-20 — WS-B: Confidence flags (adaptive margins)

**Choice:** Confidence flags using adaptive P33/P67 margin thresholds from calibration data. Predictive across both pairs.

**Measured:**
- bge→e5: high-conf R@10=0.955, low-conf R@10=0.637 (gap=0.318)
- MiniLM→bge: high-conf R@10=0.875, low-conf R@10=0.651 (gap=0.224)

**Why:** Users need per-query confidence to know when to trust migrated results. Adaptive thresholds (percentile-based) work across different score distributions without manual tuning.

**Artifacts:** `benchmarks/results/ws_b_confidence_flags.json`

### 2026-07-20 — WS-C: Independent inverse-α

**Choice:** RidgeMapping now has separate `_chosen_inv_alpha` for inverse direction, fitted independently from forward α. Stored in `.isotrieve` header.

**Why:** Optimal regularization differs between forward (Y = XW) and inverse (X = YW_inv) directions. Fitting α independently for each direction improves inverse quality without affecting forward.

**Measured:** +2.17pts (bge→e5), +2.23pts (MiniLM→bge). Consistent across pairs. Optimal inv alpha differs from forward (0.178 vs 0.316 on bge→e5).

**Artifacts:** `benchmarks/results/ws_c_independent_inv_alpha.json`

### 2026-07-20 — WS-C: TSVD shrinkage NULL RESULT

**Choice:** RidgeMapping now accepts `rank=r` parameter for TSVD shrinkage, but NOT recommended. Default is `rank=None` (no shrinkage).

**Measured:** rank=512 only -0.33pt, rank=256 -1.69pt, rank=128 -2.33pt. Quality degrades monotonically with rank reduction.

**Why keep it:** Useful for storage-constrained deployments (large mappings). But for most users, the quality loss isn't worth it.

**Artifacts:** `benchmarks/results/ws_c_tsvd_shrinkage.json`

### 2026-07-20 — WS-C: Procrustes centering REVERTED

**Choice:** Do NOT auto-center embeddings before Procrustes mapping. Production `OrthogonalProcrustesMapping` uses `V @ R^T` for inverse (no centering).

**Why reverted:** Q3 measured held-out cosine alignment (X_ho mapped to Y space vs Y_ho), NOT serve-mode retrieval. Centering breaks serve-mode because centered queries don't match uncentered source doc distribution. The -55pt swing was a measurement artifact, not a production bug.

**Lesson:** Always validate against actual serve-mode retrieval (R@10), not just alignment metrics.

### 2026-07-20 — WS-D: Gate v3 (margin compression)

**Choice:** `_predict_retention()` now accepts `margin_compression` parameter. When margin_compression < 0.85, widen prediction interval.

**Why:** Score compression indicates the mapping quality is uncertain. Wider intervals make the gate more conservative, reducing false PASS verdicts.

### 2026-07-20 — Vector DB adapters (v0.2)

**Choice:** Add ChromaDB and LangChain adapters. ChromaDB gets serve-mode (`IsotrieveChromaFunction`) and offline migration (`migrate_collection`). LangChain gets `IsotrieveEmbeddings` shim.

**Why:** Most users interact with vector databases through ORMs/clients. Thin adapters that apply Isotrieve mappings at the DB layer eliminate the need for users to manage mapping files manually.

**Adapters implemented:**
- `isotrieve.adapters.chroma.IsotrieveChromaFunction` — Chroma `EmbeddingFunction`
- `isotrieve.adapters.chroma.migrate_collection()` — offline migration
- `isotrieve.adapters.langchain.IsotrieveEmbeddings` — LangChain `Embeddings` shim
- `isotrieve.adapters.base.EmbeddingAdapter` — core ABC
- `isotrieve.adapters.base.VectorStoreAdapter` — core ABC
- `isotrieve.adapters.base.MigrationReport` — migration metadata

**Tests:** 21 tests for adapters (13 ChromaDB, 8 LangChain), all passing.
